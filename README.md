*June 2024*

## Overview
 
Welcome to the repository of the project "Spatial Regression Analysis of Regional Unemployment Rates and Diabetes Prevalence". This project was developed as part of the Design and Analysis of Experiments course under the supervision of Professor Cholmin Kang. The primary goal of this project is to analyze the relationship between unemployment rates and diabetes prevalence using global and regional data.

## Features

### üîç Study and Analysis

- **Socioeconomic Factors**: Analyzed the relationship between unemployment rates and diabetes prevalence using global and regional data.
- **Models Used**: Employed Lasso, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models to evaluate the impact of various socioeconomic factors on diabetes rates.

### üìâ Spatial Autoregression

- **Spatial Autoregression Models (SAR)**: Utilized SAR models to examine the correlation between unemployment rates and diabetes prevalence in Korean regions.
- **Significant Findings**: Discovered a significant negative correlation between unemployment rates and diabetes prevalence, offering insights for public health policy development.

## Project Structure

### 1. Data Collection and Preparation

- **Data Sources**: 
  - Global diabetes prevalence data from The Lancet, World Bank, and Our World in Data.
  - Regional unemployment rates and diabetes diagnosis data from Statistics Korea and the Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency.
  - Spatial data from GEO-SERVICE-WEB.
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and merged datasets, handled missing values, and scaled the data for analysis.

### 2. Model Development

- **Predictive Models**: Implemented Lasso, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting models to predict diabetes prevalence based on socioeconomic factors.
- **Spatial Regression**: Conducted spatial regression analysis using SAR models to understand the regional impact of unemployment rates on diabetes prevalence in Korea.

### 3. Analysis and Visualization

- **Correlation Analysis**: Identified key variables influencing diabetes rates through correlation matrices and scatter plots.
- **Spatial Visualization**: Visualized regional unemployment rates and diabetes prevalence using maps to highlight geographic patterns.

## Results and Insights

- **Negative Correlation**: Found a significant negative correlation between unemployment rates and diabetes prevalence, suggesting that higher unemployment rates might be associated with lower diabetes prevalence.
- **Policy Implications**: Provided insights for developing public health policies that consider regional socioeconomic factors to address diabetes prevalence.
